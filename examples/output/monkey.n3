# Proof for derived triple:
#   _:b1 a :Animal .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   _:b1 a :Monkey .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?X a :Monkey .
#   } => {
#     ?X a :Animal .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?X = _:b1
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.

_:b1 a :Animal .
