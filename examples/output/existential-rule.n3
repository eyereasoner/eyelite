# Proof for derived triple:
#   :Socrates :is _:sk_0 .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   :Socrates a :Human .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?S a :Human .
#   } => {
#     ?S :is _:B .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?S = :Socrates
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.

:Socrates :is _:sk_0 .

# Proof for derived triple:
#   :Plato :is _:sk_1 .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   :Plato a :Human .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?S a :Human .
#   } => {
#     ?S :is _:B .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?S = :Plato
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
