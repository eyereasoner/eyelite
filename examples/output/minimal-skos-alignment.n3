# Proof for derived triple:
#   anpr:VehicleWithPlate ex:treatedAs ref:Car .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   anpr:VehicleWithPlate skos:broadMatch ref:Car .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?a skos:broadMatch ?b .
#   } => {
#     ?a ex:treatedAs ?b .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?a = anpr:VehicleWithPlate
#   ?b = ref:Car
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.

# Proof for derived triple:
#   anpr:PassengerCar ex:treatedAs ref:Car .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   anpr:PassengerCar skos:broader anpr:VehicleWithPlate .
#   anpr:VehicleWithPlate ex:treatedAs ref:Car .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?x skos:broader ?y .
#     ?y ex:treatedAs ?z .
#   } => {
#     ?x ex:treatedAs ?z .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?x = anpr:PassengerCar
#   ?y = anpr:VehicleWithPlate
#   ?z = ref:Car
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
