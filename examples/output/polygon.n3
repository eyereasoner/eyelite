# Proof for derived triple:
#   ((4 2) (6 2) (7 6) (4 6) (5 5) (5 3) (4 2)) polygon:area 7 .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   ((4 2) (6 2) (7 6) (4 6) (5 5) (5 3) (4 2)) polygon:area 7 .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ((4 2) (6 2) (7 6) (4 6) (5 5) (5 3) (4 2)) polygon:area ?AREA .
#   } => {
#     ((4 2) (6 2) (7 6) (4 6) (5 5) (5 3) (4 2)) polygon:area ?AREA .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?AREA = 7
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
