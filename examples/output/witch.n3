# Proof for derived triple:
#   :DUCK a :ISMADEOFWOOD .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   :DUCK a :FLOATS .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?x a :FLOATS .
#   } => {
#     ?x a :ISMADEOFWOOD .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?x = :DUCK
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
