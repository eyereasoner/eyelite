# Proof for derived triple:
#   :Alice :hates :Nobody .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   ?SCOPE log:notIncludes {
#       :Alice :hates :Bob .
#   } .
#   :Bob a :Person .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?SCOPE log:notIncludes {
#         :Alice :hates ?X .
#     } .
#     ?X a :Person .
#   } => {
#     :Alice :hates :Nobody .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?X = :Bob
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.

:Alice :hates :Nobody .
