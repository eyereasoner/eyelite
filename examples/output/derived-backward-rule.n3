# Proof for derived triple:
#   {
#       ?x :childOf ?y .
#   } <= {
#       ?y :parentOf ?x .
#   } .
# It holds because the following instantiated premises are all satisfied:
#   :parentOf :invOf :childOf .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?p :invOf ?q .
#   } => {
#     {
#         ?x ?q ?y .
#     } <= {
#         ?y ?p ?x .
#     } .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?p = :parentOf
#   ?q = :childOf
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.

# Proof for derived triple:

# It holds because the following instantiated premises are all satisfied:

#   } => {
#     ?x :hasParent ?y .
