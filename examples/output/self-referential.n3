# Proof for derived triple:
#   :answer :contains log:implies .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   {
#       ?X__0 ?Y__1 ?Z__2 .
#   } => {
#       :answer :contains ?Y__1 .
#   } .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?X => ?Z .
#   } => {
#     :answer :contains log:implies .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?X = {
#     ?X__0 ?Y__1 ?Z__2 .
#   }
#   ?Z = {
#     :answer :contains ?Y__1 .
#   }
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
