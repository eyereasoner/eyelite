# Proof for derived triple:
#   :alice :mustHave :dogLicense .
# It holds because the following instance of the rule body is provable:
#   :alice :hasDog :dog5 .
#   (1 {
#       :alice :hasDog ?Dog .
#   } (1 1 1 1 1)) log:collectAllIn ?Scope .
#   (1 1 1 1 1) math:sum 5 .
#   5 math:greaterThan 4 .
# via the schematic forward rule:
#   {
#     ?Subject :hasDog ?Any .
#     (1 {
#         ?Subject :hasDog ?Dog .
#     } ?List) log:collectAllIn ?Scope .
#     ?List math:sum ?Count .
#     ?Count math:greaterThan 4 .
#   } => {
#     ?Subject :mustHave :dogLicense .
#   } .
# with substitution (on rule variables):
#   ?Any = :dog5
#   ?Count = 5
#   ?List = (1 1 1 1 1)
#   ?Subject = :alice
# Therefore the derived triple above is entailed by the rules and facts.
